This is a web application that shows real time current headline news from News API. 
Once a user clicks on an news article, instead of seeing the whole content, it is passed into another API that summaries the entire news article for the users. 
A user can also click to see the entire orignal news article by clicking on the 'Full Article" Button. 

A real time twitter feed based on 'trending news' streams on the right hand side of the application where users can see all the trending news tweets. This is accomplished by fetching the real time feed from the Twitter API. 

A user can also create a new story/ blog by adding a new post that other users can see from the home page. 

Users can also discuss in a chatroom forum determined by the topic of conversation they enter in the chatroom sign in page. Multiple users can therefore talk to one another in real time.
